# Introduction


## Streamlining a Tango city's events pipeline

Every successful tango city has a vibrant local
social dance scene
with many contributors and participants.

People are constantly arriving and travelling,
and projects are constantly being revised.
The complexity of many dynamic changes at short notices
can contribute
to delays and miscommunication.

__TTWIS Data Project__  is a software project
to bring together tango
organisers, participants, visitors,
local businesses, artistes and teachers,
to achieve smoother information distribution
for a community.

Better technology can help to make the scene easier
to navigate, increasing engagement, and
reduce friction due to missing attendance
or scheduling.


## Things I Can Do

As an open source project, TTWIS allows anyone to
use, contribute, make suggestions, and participate
in the development:

+ contribute to the source codes
+ add or amend configuration data
+ add or amend project art, photos, or media
+ help to test and validate the codes
+ create applications that make use of the output of this project
+ write or translate documentation
+ comment or suggest improvements


## Components

The core components of TTWIS are: Google Calendar,
Google Map, and Google Sheet.

This project comprises:

- a static website generator based on Vitepress / Vue3 / Vite2 / Javascript that creates a static website for the documentation, demos and guides

- configuration data that provisions each city's external source data (which point to the Google calendar, maps and sheet sources)

- automation that retrieves the source data
several times each day for processing, and rebuilds the
static website

- software library to manage, copy, combine, parse and display
event data from multiple Google Calendars into a
single GCalendar data.

- software library to handle formatting rules to change
calendar description into rich multimedia layouts.

## Team Support

As this project is hosted on Github, there are other benefits as follows:

- source code management and change tracking, allowing easier branch merging, reversal of changes, and error tracking

- issue management forum, where all participants can add their suggestions or feedbacks, and new features can
be tracked

- automatic code runners that can automate backend processing
