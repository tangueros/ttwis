# Motivation


The project began as an attempt to simplify the updating
of "Tango This Week In Singapore" Facebook Group (hence the TTWIS name)

Singapore's social tango scene has many independent
tango event producers (_which is a good thing_), but
with this bonanza
comes the complexity of keeping track of what
is happening, and sometimes people forget
about an event that is about to happen, or
timeslots are double-booked
(_which is not so good_):

* Many producers do not have a permanent venue,
  the location of events are also frequently changing
  as opportunities to use a space appear.

* Organisers post their event announcements on Facebook,
  but sometimes forget to include address, price, contact information etc.

* When tango tourists come to Singapore, they wish to
  consult a schedule which may be several weeks in the
  future.

Only if the community has someone with deep knowledge of everything happening in the scene, and the time and
energy to organise that information
-- _like Singapore and Don Ferrin_ -- , we get:

* a clean summary of each week's schedule
* the missing information fact-checked,
* incoming visitors can get authoritative answers.

Looking at the wider communities, most of the active tango cities in Asia have very similar problems regarding their community-wide social tango calendars.
In Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, someone in
those communities has stepped up to compile the data, and
post that schedule for the benefit of others.

Perhaps a better way forward is to use smarter software to automate the process?  We would like to explore this.
